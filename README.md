# README: Analyzing Kellogg Dataset

## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of a dataset related to Kellogg's products, focusing on demographic, consumption, and behavioral data. The analysis was performed using R, leveraging statistical and visual tools to gain insights into various parameters like age, weight, income, and preferences.

---

## Prerequisites
### Software Requirements:
- **R Programming Language**: Ensure R is installed on your system.
- **RStudio**: Recommended IDE for R programming.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `scales`

### Dataset:
- The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `cornflakes2.csv`. Ensure the file is placed in the working directory before running the scripts.

## Key Analysis Performed

### 1. Age:
- Calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation of the `Age` column.
- Visualized the distribution using a histogram.

### 2. Gender:
- Analyzed the frequency and proportion of genders.
- Created a pie chart to represent gender distribution.

### 3. Weight (in kg):
- Computed statistical measures like mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range, and summary.
- Used histograms to visualize the data.

### 4. Annual Household Income:
- Analyzed household income using mean, median, standard deviation, and summary statistics.
- Visualized with histograms and boxplots.

### 5. Diabetes:
- Frequency analysis and pie chart visualization.
- Converted the `Diabete` column to numeric values (1 for 'Yes' and 0 for 'No').

### 6. Flavors Consumed:
- Frequency analysis with bar plots and pie charts.

### 7. Bowls Per Week:
- Descriptive statistics and histograms to understand weekly consumption patterns.

### 8. Time of Consumption:
- Analyzed and visualized consumption timings with bar plots and pie charts.

### 9. Flavor Rating:
- Statistical measures and histogram visualization.

### 10. Monthly Spend on Cornflakes:
- Statistical analysis with summary measures and visualizations (histograms and boxplots).

### 11. Likelihood to Continue Buying:
- Frequency analysis with bar plots and pie charts.

### 12. Likelihood to Recommend:
- Frequency analysis with visualizations.

### 13. Residence:
- Frequency analysis and visualizations.

### 14. Packaging and Health Ratings:
- Statistical analysis and visualization using bar plots and pie charts.

### 15. Correlation Analysis:
- Analyzed correlations among selected variables, including:
  - Age
  - Weight (in kg)
  - Monthly Spend on Cornflakes
  - Bowls per Week
  - Flavor Rating
  - Packaging Rating
  - Health Rating

### 16. Regression Analysis:
- Built a linear regression model to predict `Monthly Spend on Cornflakes` using:
  - Age
  - Weight (in kg)
  - Flavor Rating
